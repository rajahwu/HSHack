Hey, Colin, Mark Wayshack calling. Did I catch you at a bad time there? Yeah, I'm a little caught up with some things right now. Okay, well, fair enough. Would it be okay if I took 30 seconds, told you why I called, and if after doesn't make sense, we could just hang up? Does that sound fair? Yeah, that's all right. Okay, great. So I'm a sales strategist who works with midsize companies to create a game plan for dramatically increasing sales. And my clients typically come to me when they're losing sales to low cost competitors. Their teams are inconsistently hitting sales targets. Or finally, they're just frustrated with a lack of results from their existing sales team. Any of those issues ring true to you? Yeah, actually. Not hitting sales goals has kind of been a problem for my company recently. Tell me just a little bit more about that. Well, you know, we have about 20 to 25 agents in my office, and it just seems like we've been losing a lot of these big condo sales to our competitors recently. We're not moving quick enough when we are showing the places we seem to be just somehow not closing the sales. I haven't been able to figure out what the real issues are, but we're. We're definitely losing some business. I mean, what have you done to fix this? You know, I've had some. Some chats with my bigger sales guys to see what the problems are that they seem to think, you know, why aren't they closing these sales compared to what they were doing six months ago and a year ago again? We haven't really been able to put our finger on something. The market is great right now. There's places that are selling in a day to two days after they go on the market, and we're just nothing getting those places. We're having people come to us. People want to buy condos. They want to move quickly, and we're just losing out on a lot of great places. It's a really common issue, I hear. What would you say this issue is costing you and your organization? Tough to say. I'd probably say around two and a half to 3 million. Okay, well, Colin, can I make a recommendation? Yeah, sure. Why don't we set up an appointment and get together face to face? I'd say it takes about 60 minutes or so, and we can talk this further. I think there are some ideas that I could share with you to really help you solve this challenge. Does that make any sense to you? Yeah, I'd be willing to set up a meeting. Okay, great. So what works for you next week? Next week? I think I'm pretty busy Monday and Tuesday, but I could do like a Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Okay. Looking at my calendar, Wednesday afternoon is fine with me. So what's best for you? Wednesday afternoon? Hold on, I'm just pulling up my calendar. Anytime after 02:00 p.m. okay. I can actually make 230 work. That's perfect. Okay, and so the address for your office, just to confirm, is eight Broadway Street, Boston, right? That's correct. Okay, great. And just before I hang up, is there anyone else that you would want to include in this conversation who might be involved in this kind of a decision? No, really, just I'm the decision maker. So I think, you know, there's nobody that I can think of that I'd want to bring along. Okay, terrific. Well then I will see you at your office and we will discuss this a little bit further then. Great. Thanks for the call, Mark. All right, thank you, Colin. So there is the actual prospecting call I want to hear from you. What ideas do you take from this reenactment?
